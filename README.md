# Electric Cat - SlugBase Edition

This is a port of Shiro_pb's awesome Electric Cat mod that makes use of the SlugBase framework.

## Features:
- Increased compatibility with other mods
- You no longer shock tamed Lizards in charged mode
- Single .DLL file, no loose assets
- Support for Jolly Coop
- AutoUpdate Support

## Installation:
**Requirements:**
- [SlugBase](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBase/releases)

**Download:**
- [ElectricCat.dll](https://github.com/LeeMoriya/ElectricCat/releases/download/v1.0/ElectricCat.dll)

## Jolly Coop
- If playing with Jolly Coop, players that are set to 'Match Player 1' will also spawn as Electric Cats.
- Manually entering charged mode will consume 4 food pips but enable charged mode for all Electric Cats.
- However, players will exit charged mode independently and can enter it independently via other means.
- Electric Cats can shock non-Electric Cat players, careful not to hurt your friends!
