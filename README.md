# Electric Cat - SlugBase Edition

*This mod adds a fourth playable slugcat, the electric cat!*
*To activate the cat's abilities get four food pips and, while standing, hold up for a few seconds. Besides that, the ability can be activated*
*by touching the zap coils in five pebbles, eating a jellyfish, holding a lantern mouse and getting shocked by a centipede.*
*The electric cat gets more agile and can stun foes on contact while the ability is activated.*


## Features:

This is a port of Shiro_pb's awesome Electric Cat mod that makes use of the SlugBase framework.
- Increased compatibility with other mods
- You no longer shock tamed Lizards in charged mode
- Single .DLL file, no loose assets
- Support for Jolly Coop
- AutoUpdate Support

## Installation:
**Requirements:**
- [SlugBase](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBase/releases)

**Download:**
- [ElectricCat.dll](https://github.com/LeeMoriya/ElectricCat/releases/download/v1.0/ElectricCat.dll)

Place the **.dll** in your Mods folder and apply with BOI if using BepInEx or the Partiality Launcher if using Partiality.

## Jolly Coop
- If playing with Jolly Coop, players that are set to 'Match Player 1' will also spawn as Electric Cats.
- Manually entering charged mode will consume 4 food pips but enable charged mode for all Electric Cats.
- However, players will exit charged mode independently and can enter it independently via other means.
- Electric Cats can shock non-Electric Cat players, careful not to hurt your friends!

### Issues
When one or more players is in charged mode, all players will gain the buff to stats it provides. I'm not sure if this is fixable due to how SlugBase and JollyCoop interact with one another.
